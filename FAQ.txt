NO LOG - NO HELP


1) Holy crap these parts are awesome but they have no fuel?!
	A) Ensure your Firespitter is up to date
	
2) So I installed the mod and the parts have no fuel!
	A) Yet again, make sure your firespitter is up to date.
	
3) I installed Version X of the mod from spacedock, it has Firespitter but I have no fuel!
	A) There is the chance that the version on spacedock has a version of Firespitter that is
	for a previous version of KSP. The bundled Firespitter is ALWAYS the latest version at release
	of the mod.  So once again, make sure firespitter is up to date.
	
4) Can you add 'X idea for part?'
	A) feel free to make requests, and once K.Yeon resumes active development we will forward the 
	suggestions on to him, if simple enough we may be able to make them before then.
