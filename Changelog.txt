STILL PRESENT BUGS:

	- Stail Inline Docking Port doesn't attach to docking ports (? needs testing with new FS and MM)
	- Stail Inline Docking&Utility Port - Docking port shaft doesn't apply texture properly and has odd inverted mesh around the top
	- OPT_k_10m_cockpit has wrong texture in intake
	- l_8m_cockpit has wrong texture in intake
	- j_engineMount_4 has wrong texture around engine mounts
	- since Build 1532 Fuel Switch is completely broken
	- Textures on several Humpback parts have odd artefacts
	- Front collision mesh on a_8m_cockpit doesn't work.

STILL TO DO:
	
	- Add working ModuleDockingBay to b_docking_port1
	- Align interior in mk23_cockpit
	- Align interior in k_10m_cockpit
	- Add missing/balance present tank cost in FS
